## **Overview**

The goal of this project is to analyze customer data for a subscription service in order to identify meaningful customer segments, uncover trends in cancellations and renewals, and provide actionable insights that can help the company improve customer retention, increase engagement, and optimize their subscription model. This project involved data exploration, segmentation, and visualization using Power BI, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights.

## **Data Sources**

The primary data source for this analysis came from the subscription service's customer database (customer data.csv). Key data attributes include:

- **Customer ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Subscription Type**: The type of subscription plan (e.g., basic, premium, family, etc.).
- **Start Date**: The date when the customer subscribed.
- **End Date**: The date when the customer canceled or renewed their subscription.
- **Payment per year**: The yearly payment made by the customer.
Additionally, customer behavior data was obtained from website logs and the subscription management system to enhance insights into usage patterns and renewal likelihood.

## **Tools Used**

- **Power BI**: For building interactive dashboards and visualizations.
- **SQL**: To query and aggregate data from the companyâ€™s database.
- **Microsoft Excel** [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com): Used for preliminary data cleaning and small-scale analysis before importing data into Power BI.

## **Data Cleaning and Preparation**

Data cleaning is a crucial step in ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the analysis. The data preparation process involved:

1. **Handling Missing Data**:
   - Identified and handled missing or null values (e.g., dropping records with missing essential fields like subscription type).
   
2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Transformed dates (start and end dates) into a usable format for time-series analysis.
   - Converted categorical variables like "Subscription Type" and "Region" into numerical formats suitable for modeling.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features such as "Subscription Duration" (calculated from the start and end date).
   - Factored in the difference between subscription start date and cancellation date.
   
4. **Outlier Detection**:
   - Detected and removed duplicates in the dataset.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis**

The EDA phase is focused on understanding the general patterns in the dataset before diving into deeper analysis. Key steps included:

1. **Univariate Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the distribution of key variables (e.g., payment amount, subscription type, region).
   - Visualized the cancellation rate by subscription type and identified if certain plans had higher rates than others.
   
2. **Bivariate Analysis**:
   - Investigated relationships between subscription duration and cancellation rate.
   - Explored correlations between customer demographics (e.g., region and subscription types)

3. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Identified seasonality trends in subscription renewals and cancellations.
   - Investigated if cancellations spiked during particular months or seasons.

## **Data Analysis**

During the data analysis phase, I performed deeper statistical analysis and machine learning modeling to derive insights that could inform decision-making:

1. **Churn Prediction**:
   - Built a churn prediction model using logistic regression and decision trees to predict the likelihood of customers canceling their subscriptions. Key features included subscription duration, payment amount, and customer engagement metrics.
   - Found that customers with lower engagement (e.g., infrequent log-ins, low session times) had a higher probability of churning.

2. **Customer Segmentation**:
   - Applied unsupervised learning (K-means clustering) to group customers into distinct segments based on behavior and payment patterns. The clusters included:
     - **High Value, High Engagement**: Customers who paid consistently and interacted frequently.
     - **Low Value, Low Engagement**: Customers who subscribed but rarely used the service.
     - **At-Risk Customers**: Customers who exhibited low engagement and showed signs of canceling.

3. **Retention Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the impact of different customer retention strategies (e.g., discounts, personalized offers) by comparing renewal rates across customer segments.


  #### SQL QUERIES
   I used SQL to extract specific insights from the dataset, such as:
- Monthly sales totals
- Product category performance
- Customer retention rates

```SQL

## **Findings and Insights**

1. **Churn Analysis**:
   - Subscription types like "basic" and "starter" plans had higher churn rates compared to premium and family plans, suggesting that customers who pay less are more likely to cancel.
   - Engagement played a critical role in retention; customers with lower usage frequency were 30% more likely to churn.

2. **Seasonality Trends**:
   - Cancellations were more frequent during specific months (e.g., post-holiday season), possibly due to budget constraints or a lack of perceived value during the off-season.

3. **High-Value Segments**:
   - A small but lucrative segment of customers (high-value, high-engagement) made up the majority of revenue, despite being a minority of the total customer base. This suggests that focusing on retaining these customers could have a significant impact on overall profitability.

4. **At-Risk Customers**:
   - Customers who were categorized as "at-risk" had much lower engagement metrics and a higher likelihood of canceling within the next 2-3 months.

---

## **Recommendations**

1. **Focus on Engagement**:
   - Develop initiatives that increase engagement, such as personalized content, notifications, and loyalty programs, particularly for customers in lower-tier plans who are more likely to churn.

2. **Targeted Retention Campaigns**:
   - Implement retention strategies, such as offering discounts or personalized offers, specifically targeted at "at-risk" customers based on their usage patterns and subscription type.

3. **Introduce Mid-Tier Plans**:
   - Consider introducing a "mid-tier" subscription plan between basic and premium offerings to bridge the gap for customers who may be priced out of premium plans but are more likely to stay than basic-plan users.

4. **Seasonal Offers**:
   - Launch seasonal promotions (e.g., end-of-year offers) to encourage customers to renew during high-risk churn periods.

## **Conclusion**

This project successfully identified key customer segments, uncovered trends in churn and engagement, and developed a set of actionable insights for improving customer retention. The Power BI dashboard serves as an interactive tool for the business team to monitor customer behavior, track key metrics, and make data-driven decisions. By focusing on customer engagement and tailoring retention strategies to high-risk segments, the company can reduce churn and increase overall revenue.
